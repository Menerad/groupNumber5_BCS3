# Registration App

## Description

This is a Flutter-based Registration App that allows users to enter personal information such as first name, middle name, last name, gender, email address, phone number, and country of birth. The app features a responsive design with different layouts for wide and narrow screens. It also includes state management using the Provider package to handle user data.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes using `SafeArea`, `Expanded`, `MediaQuery`, and `LayoutBuilder`.
- **State Management**: Manages user data with the Provider package.
- **Navigation**: Transitions between the registration form and a summary screen displaying the entered details.
- **Image Gallery**: Displays four images when the Home menu item is clicked.
